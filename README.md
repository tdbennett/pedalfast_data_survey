#### This one-question survey was sent using SurveyMonkey to 17 investigators at 17 U.S. academic medical centers who might be potential secondary users of PEDALFAST data. This repository is the public archive of the survey.




The PEDiatric vALidation oF vAriableS in TBI (PEDALFAST) study enrolled approximately 400 children with TBI at Primary Children's Hospital in Salt Lake City, UT and Children's Hospital Colorado in Aurora, CO between 2013 and 2017.

PEDALFAST was the first study to report the use of an important new outcome measure, the Functional Status Scale (FSS), in children with TBI (PMID 27753754). It also supported the development and validation of computational tools (phenotypes) to identify neurosurgical and critical care events in databases containing information about children with TBI (PMID 28252524).

PEDALFAST captured demographic, injury, and clinical event information about all eligible patients, with specific attention to neurosurgical and critical care procedures and interventions. We tracked clinical events from the ED to the ICU to the acute care floor and ultimately hospital discharge. The study also captured information about the first computed tomography (CT) scan read by the hospitalâ€™s radiologists, whether initially performed at a referral facility or at the study hospital.

This question does not qualify as Human Subjects Research according to the Office of Human Research Protections.
